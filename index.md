![proc]({% link assets/citations.jpg %}){: style="width:17%; float:right; margin-right: 0em;"}

I am an assistant professor at the Australian National University, Canberra, in
the School of Computing. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and
Engineering from Ghent University (Belgium) in 2019.  My doctoral advisor was
[Lieven Eeckhout](https://users.elis.ugent.be/~leeckhou/). I also hold an M.S. in
Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. 

I am interested in computer systems in general and memory and storage systems
in particular. My research approach intersects the boundary between the
hardware, OS, and language runtime.

I serve on the reviewing committees of top-tier computer architecture, systems,
and programming language conferences.

### Current Research

My current emphasis is on the evaluation and optimization of the emerging
memory and storage hierarchy.  I investigate cooperative hardware/software
approaches to optimize the memory/storage hierarchy.


### Recent News

I have recently evaluated production persistent memory from Intel for managed
(Java) workloads and text indexing and search.

### Research Infrastructure

Thanks to generous support from the ANU start-up funding, I have built an
in-house research infrastructure for evaluating emerging non-volatile memories.
Our infrastructure includes terabytes of Intel Optane persistent memory and
state-of-the-art solid-state drives.

### Ph.D. Student Openings

I am looking to recruit new Ph.D. students. My ongoing research requires good
system-building skills. My current students are not afraid to customize
industrial-strength software, such as Apache Spark and Lucene, OpenJDK, and the
Linux OS. The nature of systems research is challenging but highly rewarding.
Our students quickly hook up with industry partners. If you are passionate
about programming and building real-world prototypes, please get in touch.
***I am especially looking for students with a background in text search and knowledge of Apache Lucene and Solr.***
